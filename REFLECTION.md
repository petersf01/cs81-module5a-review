## Reflection

# What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
I've seen higher-order functions in Javascript code before but didn't understand them. This module was very useful to understand the syntax and what is actually happening. They are very terse and powerful. More can be acheived with less code and once you are used to them it makes it eaiser to understand as well.

# What was the most confusing part?
I think the syntax was the most confusing part just because it was new to me. Also the parameter part of arrow notation threw me off as it can be any name. At first I thought it was tied to the original object somehow.
